# Programming Practice

I'm using this repo to learn some programming tricks as I work through sample technical interview questions. The idea here is to practice writing algorithms for random questions I find during my research and prepare myself for the possiblity of being asked similar questions in the future.

I'm also using these questions to simply get better at programming and focus on what I perceive to be weak areas (especialy testing)

Many of these algorithms are solutions to problems I've encountered while reading [Programming Interviews Exposed](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing-ebook/dp/B008SGNJOW/ref=tmm_kin_title_0) which I highly recommend to anyone else learning a new programming language. (A big thanks to [my brother](http://www.github.com/ndonnellan) for turning me on to this book). 

Tests are run by doing

    cd desired_folder
    nosetests
