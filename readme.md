# Programming Practice

I'm using this repo to learn some programming tricks as I work through sample technical interview questions. The idea here is to practice writing algorithms for random questions I find during my research and prepare myself for the possiblity of being asked similar questions in the future.

I'm also using these questions to simply get better at programming and focus on what I perceive to be weak areas (especialy testing)

### Shell command to run all unittest tests

  python -m unittest discover Github/random_questions '*_test.py'
